		<h1>Builtin Plugins</h1>
		
		<p>
			So what functions are available to you? Dragonfly has a <%(link_to "core set" "dragonfly_api")%> of contexts and functions that are always available (in the lib folder). Its plugins (located in <span class="code">dragonfly-framework/plugins-[in]active</span>) provide additional functionality:
		</p>
		<h2>Dragonfly Database</h2>
		<p>
			Dragonfly includes its own generic database access interface called <span class="code">DF.DB</span>.
			It serves as an alternative to the individual database wrappers included as part of newLISP's standard modules.
		</p>
		<p>
			DF.DB aims to provide a high-quality, efficient, and standard interface to various databases.
			Currently only SQLite3 is supported but more databases are on their way. You are welcome to use
			newLISP's various database modules as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			DF.DB also comes with a very basic ORM layer called DB.OBJ.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find it in the <span class="code">plugins-inactive/db</span> folder. The API is
			<%(link_to "available here" "api/db")%>.
		</p>
		<h2>Dragonfly SMTP</h2>
		<p>
			Dragonfly includes its own SMTP plugin which builds and improves upon the SMTP modules that come with
			the standard newLISP distribution. Dragonfly's SMTP module has the following advantages over the 
			SMTP modules that come with newLISP:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Full support for proper encoding of UTF-8 strings</li>
			<li>Improved interface and implementation for handling attachments</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This plugin (like all optional plugins) is located in the <span class="code">plugins-inactive</span> folder.
			The API is <%(link_to "available here" "api/smtp")%>.
		</p>
		<h2>Dragonfly's example-site functions</h2>
		<p>
			These include all of the files in the plugins folders that begin with <span class="code">dragonfly_</span>. They are used by this website to various conveniences and demos. Some of their functionality includes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating links between views</li>
			<li>Examples for using:
				<ul><li>twitter</li>
					<li>sqlite3</li>
					<li>parsing feeds</li>
					<li>AJAX with jQuery</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Artful Code Modules</h2>
		<p>
			Dragonfly includes several of Jeff Ober's <a href="https://github.com/kanendosei/artful-newlisp">Artful Code modules</a>, including functions for:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Session management</li>
			<li>JSON parsing and creation from newLISP lists</li>
			<li>Various utility functions for web-based programming</li>
			<li>Generating HTTP requests</li>
			<li>Encoding and decoding HTML entities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Have a look in the <span class="code">plugins-inactive/artfulcode</span> folder to see the included ones. Documentation for all of Jeff's modules can be found <a href="https://github.com/kanendosei/artful-newlisp">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Misc</h2>
		<p>Additional plugins include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>nldb.lsp - a simple list-based database by <a href="https://newlisper.wordpress.com/">cormullion</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>More Plugins</h2>
		<p>
			Modules make for excellent plugins! There's a <a href="http://www.newlisp.org/modules/">list</a> of available modules on newLISP's site. The newLISP distribution comes with a bunch of them, including functions for cryptography, SMTP, databases, and more!
		</p>
		<p>Watch this space for Dragonfly specific plugins as they become available.
		</p>
